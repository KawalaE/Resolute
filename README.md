# Resolute
The Fullstack Issue Tracker App is built using `Next.js`, `React`, `TypeScript`, `Tailwind CSS`, `Radix UI`, `Prisma`, and `NextAuth.js` for authentication via Google and GitHub providers. This app allows users to efficiently manage issues by adding, editing, and organizing them by status (open, in progress, closed) and priority (high, medium, low). Users can also assign issues to team members, leave comments, and view statistics related to the issues.
